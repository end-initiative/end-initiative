## Academics

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

When your character dedicates time to studies, they may choose a subject on the skills in your character sheet or of a specialty subject by the classes offered from the school. It is assumed that you spend time as often as you can studying. By spending time studying, you will gain 1 tally. At 5 points, you can attempt a d20 roll into a skill you call out ahead of time, and on a 18-20, you gain a permanent +1 misc. bonus to a skill of your choice.

If you have a book on a subject that is not from The Spire library resources, you can earn 2 tallys instead of one from reading it, but that subject has its own tallys separate from the normal pool of tallys, known as specific tallys. At 5 specific tallys, you may make a d20 roll for that skill, and on a 11-20, you gain a permanent +1 misc. bonus to that skill.

All students have a class that they naturally excelled in during their fletchling days, and carries on into their time as a Sparrow. Starting as a Sparrow, you automatically have a +1 in one specialty subject and are proficient in it. From there on, you must gain a +3 misc. bonus in another specialty subject through studying to gain proficiency in that subject as well.

## Artificer

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: 2nd, 8th

The artificer’s services are up for graduated students. Every new graduate is allowed a maximum of 2 items to be improved as a graduation gift. Any further improvements require points or gold. Each point is the equivalent of 100 gold when it comes to enchantments. Prices are normally rounded up for uneven amounts, but the Artificers have been known to allow a smidge of haggling.
Come to then for less orthodox tinkerings to see if they can help you.

You can also volunteer your magical services and work for the Artificer. You must be proficient in Arcana or a few other spells to be useful to him. You will roll 2d4 and receive 2 gold per the total you roll. This determines how busy he worked you and thought you earned. He accepts student help on Secondday and Eightday

## Classmates

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

By spending time with classmates, you can make them more willing to lend you a hand. Whenever you go on a mission that isn't delegated to you by your Hawks, you can ask classmates to come with you for assistance provided they are available. You can even see if they can help you study for a subject of exams the day before.

When you ask a classmate, you need to have at least spent some time with them outside of school for them to consider it, and if you have, then you must succeed in hitting their Friendship DC with you. All classmates start at a Friendship DC that is unique to them. Normally, it takes 2 instances of spending time with them to decrease a classmates DC by 1. However, on the very first roll of these 2 rolls, you may attempt to roll with your Charisma modifier and hit their current Friendship DC to skip the 2nd instance.

There is no penalty for not making the DC, you will just need another instance of spending time with them. You can only have a maximum of 2 classmates accompany your group on a mission.

If you ask a classmate to help you study for an exam the day before the exam, you will recieve a +1d6 bonus to a skill they are proficient in of your choosing to your test roll of that subject.d

Be aware, Classmates are only available on certain times of certain days. Learn their schedules to better plan your week. You may only hang out with someone once per day.

You need to lease a booth on Market Street for 10+1d10 gold (Fluctuating availability of spaces). Each tool kit has a different degree of difficulty associated with it that determines how hard it is to turn a profit. This takes into account start-up costs of materials and or work done.

## Culinary Indulgence

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: 3rd, 4th

Exotic food at the market is always abound with how popular a stop Bridgetown is for the Broken Sea. By scouring the markets and partaking in unique dishes, you can give your body the edge in your next encounter.

For 1d10 gold pieces, you can spend time in the market and then roll a d20 if you want to spend that much. 0-3 the Food you find is good, but not beneficial healthwise. On a 4-10, you gain 1d4+1 temp HP. On an 11-15, you gain 1d6+1 temporary hit points. And on a 16-20, you gain 1d8+1 temporary hit points (The temporary hit points do not become effective until your next encounter or when you next take damage).

While you can visit the market multiple times, boosts do not stack and the most recent successful visit dictates your temporary hit points. If you are proficient in Cooks Utensils, you can spot the true delicacies in the market and thus the minimum roll you can get is a 4.

## Gale Gill Inn

Availability: Night

Profitable Days: 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th

You can enjoy yourself or perform at Bridgetown's renown Gale Gill Inn. If you spend time and money here on drinks and food, you can gain additional benefits to other activities.

You can read a book while eating and drinking while you sit on the peaceful seaside pier. Doing this gives you a +1 to the next 1d4 skill checks you perform of the subject you read about. Doing this costs 2 gold. (This reading does not count as studying).

You can also enjoy yourself with the fellow patrons of the Inn by singing songs and sharing stories. Doing this gives you a Misc. +1d4 to the next time you hang out with a classmate when attempting to either further decrease their Friendship DC or recruit them to join you on a mission. Only Classmates available at night are available for this but this 1d4 counts towards all of them for up to 1 week, and then is lost. Doing this costs you 6 gold.

Alternatively, you can be the entertainment for the customers by performing for the night on Fifthday and Tenthday if you are proficient in Performance. Based on your performance check, you can choose what you'd like as your reward from a list. You can also invite a classmate to come see your performance. If the bonus you choose is to increase the tally for a classmate, do be aware that you cannot decrease their Friendship DC by this method, you will still need to hang out with them as described in the Classmates section for that last push. (Naturally failing still nets you a "Not Impressed" despite bonuses.)

| 1-8 (Not Impressed)    | 9-18 (Pleasant Performance)          | 19-23 (Excellent Performance) | 24+ (Moved to tears)             |

## Gambling

Availability: Evening and Night

Profitable Days: 1st, 7th, 9th

There are certain areas of Bridgetown that you can go to if you know the right people to get in on some games of chance. Attending these gambling houses requires a successful Sneak check of DC 15 to not be noticed entering and bring attention to the establishment. Failing does not waste your time, but prevents you from gambling that night. If you are proficient in disguise kits, you have advantage on this Sneak check.

Once inside you can choose to partake in cards or dice. All gambling is a double or nothing wager with a minimum of 5 gold and a maximum of 20. All wagers are declared before games begin. Gambling is held on Firstday, Seventhday, and Ninthday.

In cards, you will be playing blackjack against the house and see who can get closest to 21 without going over. You will each roll 3d10 and have 2 opportunities to reroll the current lowest number of your rolls. The player must choose their options of rerolls before the house rolls their initial dice. The house must stop once they hit 17 however. If you have proficiency in cards, you get 3 rerolls instead of 2. You can play twice in a single visit.

In dice, you will be playing a game of craps. You will be playing as the shooter. As shooter, you will roll 2d6 and on a 7, or 11, you win. On a 2, 3, or 12, you lose. If you get a different number besides the aforementioned numbers, that becomes your target number. You will then keep rolling the dice until you get the target number again, in which case you win, or if you roll a 7, in which case you lose. If you have proficiency in dice, then you can choose a second additional number as a target number when rolling for the latter case. You can play twice in a single visit.

## Good Night's Sleep

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

Sometimes the best thing to do is have a nice light meal, a warm drink, and head to sleep for the night a bit early. Doing so the day before an adventure will net you +1 on initiative rolls and +1 against Wisdom saving throws for the first encounter of your next adventure. This benefit can only be gained from sleeping in your dorm bed.

## Harbor

Availability: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th

Profitable Days: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th

Students now have the option to store vessels in the harbor at the cost of 1 point per month. Each student may only store 1 vessel at a time, and said vessel must fit within the dock's parameters (35’ across maximum).

Additionally you can fish at the docks if you have a rod, bait, and tackle. While fishing at the docks you will have 3 chances to roll a d6 and guess your result. If within 1 of your guess, you catch a small fish that sells for 2 gold. If you match your guess, you get a big catch that sells for 4 gold. If you are an Outlander, Pirate, Sailor, or Swashbuckler, you gold yield for small fish increases by 1d4 and 1d6 for big catches. You can only fish once per day, and the dock is closed on Fifthday and Tenthday for dock upkeep and deliveries.

## Laboratory

Availability: 3rd, 4th, 8th, 9th, 10th

Profitable Days: 3rd, 4th

Students who are proficient in Biology or Herbology may use the laboratory to expend their ingredients in order to make potions or medicine. If you do not have the means or ingredients, services of the Lab may be purchased from the Laboratory as well. Supplies are often limited, so the Laboratory will sometimes send requests to The Spire in order to replenish their stock. You can always try and buy ingredients to use for yourself. Rolling a D20 determines if they have enough in stock for you to buy, DC 10.

A typical potion will require 3-6 ingredients. Ingredients range from a rating of Common to Legendary with various potencies per level of rarity. When brewing a potion, you need an ingredient that specializes as an effect, one as a synthesizer, and one as an enhancer. When you go to brew a potion, you will roll a Biology or Herbology skill check with the DC determined by the used ingredients to successfully brew the potion. Adding the potency score of all ingredients gives you the DC to try and brew the potion. The DC is reduced by 1 for every +1 misc. bonus you have to the Herbology subject. Adding more than the minimum ingredients to a brew will change the effects of the potion. Adding extra effect ingredients will increase the bonus of the effect. Adding extra synthesizers will decrease the DC for a successful brew. And adding extra enhancer ingredients will grant an extra use of that potion, tough sometimes you will need to add more than 1 synthesizer and/or enhancer for them to be strong enough to grant an extra use. A potion takes so long to brew and a student can only have 1 concoction brewing on the side when it is not for class at a time. Do not worry if you are not present when the potion is finished brewing, as it will be taken care of by staff.

| Rarity    | Potency | Effect/(#)Resist | (#)Synthesizer | (#)Enhancer |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Common    | 1       | +1d4/ (1) 1      | (1) DC -1      | (1) 2 use   |

| Legendary | 9       | +2d8/ (1) 3      | (1) DC -3      | (1) 4 uses  |

| 25-30   | 21  | 6            |
| 31-45   | 23  | 7            |

You can also work in the laboratory if you have proficiency in Nature or Herbology, or if you know Druidcraft or Speak With Animals. Working in the Laboratory lets you roll 1d8 and earn double what you roll. Laboratory jobs are available on Thirddday and Fourthday.

## Library

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

The Library provides an excellent place to study and explore for information of the land. The Spire also has exclusive texts, requiring a fee in exchange for a chance to acquire some of their knowledge.

For 1 point, a student may, with supervision, read and choose 1 exclusive text in the field of a skill. 1 point lasts for a month worth of access. An exclusive text takes 3 days to finish, or 2 if you have proficiency in the subject of linguistics. When you finish reading a text, your next Studies roll you perform to attempt for a Misc. bonus will have an increased range of 14-20 instead of the normal 18-20 until you succeed at a roll. You are only allowed to read 1 exclusive text fully per week.

If you are a Cloistered Scholar, Loremaster, or Bard of Lore you can pay 25 gold instead of a point.

You can also check out books from the Library, but they have a due date of 2 weeks. Books from the library are special in that they last for 10 instances of study instead of 5 like other books. Additionally, fully finishing a rented book grants an additional study point upon completion. You can only check out books when going on a mission assigned by The Spire to keep the texts out of unnecessary risk as much as possible. Overdue books accrue a late fee of 5 gold per day they are late. If you are unable to return the book by it being lost or destroyed, your tuition for the next month increases by 100 gold.

## Quartermaster

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

The Quartermaster can get his hands on anything and everything; "I just need the time", he claims. From weapons, armor, materials, and equipment, he will do all he can to find it. A special request from the quartermaster costs 1 point, provided he doesn’t already have what you seek. A special request would be for an item that is not found in the Player's Handbook such as a cage with specific requirements. The item you request will still have a price associated with it in addition to the point paid to find such an item. Don't ask the impossible though, you need to give a lead on where he can find the item if he himself doesn't know where to begin looking. Because the Quartermaster likes to ramble any trip to him will take some time.

## Regular Job

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: Always

Lots of the citizens of Bridgetown depend on students as an occasional workforce. You can take jobs from them for the day and earn gold as a reward. You may roll a d20, with a DC of 20 minus the number of skills your are proficient in, to try and find yourself a job. [Ex: if you are proficient in 4 skills, your DC is 16]. If you find a job you are proficient in, you will earn 1d6+3 gold. You can work 2 different jobs within 1 week. If you are unsuccessful in finding a job, your time for that portion of the day is wasted. Additionally, you will roll 1d20 to try and roll a 19 or 20 at the end of successfully working to see if you did such a good job that your employer gives you something extra for your hard work.

| 1d4 | DC                           |
| --- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | Free book from the bookstore |
| 2   | Free culinary meal           |
| 3   | 1d12 gold                    |
| 4   | roll for a Trinket           |

## Shopping

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

While the Quartermaster has lots of items needed by adventurers, the local merchants and traders in Bridgetown may have some specialty, novelty, or more frivolous items you may find yourself wanting from time to time.

You can also look for books in Bridgetown, but it may be tough to find what you need. You will need to roll a d6 and on a 4-5, you find a book while on a 6 you find 2. The type of book you find will be based on a few rolls. You will start with a d20 roll and depending on what you roll, you will have the option to take the roll or go for a specialty subject book if that is an option. If you choose the specialty subject book, you will roll a d10, d6, or d4 depending on what you rolled, though some instances are just one to one trade off of skill book to specialty subject books.

On occasion, a festival or caravan of merchants will be in town. When this is the case, unique items may be available, but what is available changes depending on what time of day you go.

## Shrine

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: 10th

The Spire has a shrine building that offers respite for residents of all beliefs. The building offers many small shrines so that those of spiritual connections and beliefs may pay their respects. If you recieve benefits of power from a Deity, you can spend time at a shrine to gain another use of channel divinity for the day, or an extra 1d20 hit points for Lay on Hands. If you don't have either of these skills but still pay homage to a deity, you will receive a +1 to a type of Saving Throw for one roll for the week as determined by a d6 roll. Continual praying does not stack effects.

You choose to help upkeep the shrines with maintenance on Tenthday for a payout of 5 gold. If you are proficient in Religion, you gain 1d4 more gold. If you can use Channel Divinity or Divine Sense, you gain 1d6 more gold.

## Sparring Grounds

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: None

The Sparring Grounds is where one goes to train their more physical skills. Many students spend time here multiple times a week to test out new moves or maintain their prowess. Rolling 1d10, a random student will be selected for who is in the sparring grounds. The student will ask for your help or challenge you in some way as described by the DM. Completing this task sufficiently gives you a specific tally into a physical skill and an attempt to further your friendship with whatever classmate you practiced with.

## Stables

Availability: Always

Profitable Days: Always

You can rent a riding horse for a deposit of 75 gold, and each day the horse is gone, you pay 5 gold upon returning. If the horse is returned hurt or not returned at all, your deposit is forfeit.

Storing horses at the stables costs 15 gold a month with a 1 time purchase of their stall for 75 gold. If you ever sell your stall, you will receive 25 gold back. Which includes that they will be fed as well. Storing things like carts costs 10 gold a month. You can work the stables anyday for 1d10 silver
